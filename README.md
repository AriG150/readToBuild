Link to the live game: 

## Purpose of the project:
When assigned this project I decided to stear away from violent games and create something that could have a longer lasting impact on the player. After considering different options, I decided to create a game to help young children learn to read.  

## Prerequisits 
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a game used in the browser. The game must have a multi player option, or multiple levels. Adhere to best practices for semantic markup for HTML and CSS files, use JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation, and deploy your game online. 

## Objectives of the game
Purpose: creating an engaging way for a small child to learn to read
